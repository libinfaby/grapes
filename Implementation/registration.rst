The registration process is not just a routine administrative task, it is the foundation upon which the entire patient journey rests. Precise registration directly impacts patient safety and care quality. It even enhances the overall patient experience and helps in building trust and confidence in the healthcare institution. 

So, paying close attention to every detail during registration is super important for making sure everything runs smoothly and patients feel taken care of.

New Patient Registration
========================

When a patient visits the hospital for the first time, they need to be registered as a patient in the software. There are several ways to do this.

* Patients can provide their details either verbally or in writing at the registration counter, and the staff can then enter this information into the 'New Patient Registration' form within the GrapesIDMR desktop application. You can access this form by navigating to **Patients > Registration > New Patient Registration**, or simply by pressing the keyboard shortcut **Ctrl + O**.
* Patients can register using the **Grapes IDMR** mobile application, which is available for both Android and iOS devices.
* Patients can utilize a QR code located near the reception area to access an online form and fill in their details digitally.

*To set up patient registration QR code, Contact Grapes administrator*
    
.. caution:: Never register a patient more than one time. This will lead to duplicate and inaccurate patient data.
