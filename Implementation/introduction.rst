Introduction
============
Implementation involves more than just installing the software; it's about seamlessly integrating the software into the hospital's systems, workflows, and processes. It's about ensuring that the software becomes an integral part of the hospital's operations to achieve specific healthcare objectives. Through proper implementation, we aim to transform the way healthcare is delivered within the hospital, improving patient care outcomes, and enhancing operational efficiency.

Key activities during implementation include gathering requirements or information from various hospital departments and management, preparing the master data, analyzing existing business processes to identify areas for improvement, training various departments and configuring the software to match the hospital's workflow. In existing systems, it involves migrating patient data from legacy systems to our software platform.

Implementation of hospital management software is a collaborative effort among stakeholders, including hospital administrators, department heads, physicians, nurses, IT professionals, and other staffs.

The initial phase of the implementation process begins with the essential task of :doc:`preparing the master data </Implementation/masters_preparation>`. Next section includes instructions about how to prepare masters effectively so that they align the software with the hospital's patient care goals, regulatory requirements, and quality standards.
