Masters Preparation
+++++++++++++++++++

Doctor Master
=============
A patient visits a hospital or clinic for doctor's consultation. Hence, preparing the Doctor Master is crucial. A well-prepared Doctor Master forms the foundation for all other associated activities to operate smoothly in a hospital or clinic. Below are the steps to prepare Doctor Master in the most efficient way.

1. DNA Registration
---------------------------------------------
DNA stands for **Doctor's Name and Address**. DNA registration is completed online and this information is stored on our servers for later use by various mobile applications.

.. note:: Before registering a doctor via DNA Registration, you'll need to configure the DNA Registration link in the **Global Settings and Policies**. Search for ``DNA Registration Link``, double click on the item and set the value as ``http://grapesdev.in:50105/dna/?app_flag=GHMS&hospital_id=<HID>`` where ``HID`` stands for the unique Hospital ID. Do the same for ``DNA Registration SMS Link`` if you want to send the link as an SMS to the doctors phone number.

.. topic:: Don't have the Hospital ID?

   Hospital ID's are usually set up by the Grapes administrator. You'll get the ID from the G-Service popup in the system tray area (if it's already running), or you can contact the grapes administrator.


After configuring the link, you can register doctors via DNA. For this,

* Open Grapes Masters from *Masters > Grapes Masters* or by pressing *ctrl + G*
* Select Doctor Master
* On the newly opened form you'll see a button at the top right corner named **DNA Registration**
* Click on the button to open the DNA Registration website

  .. attention:: If you still see an error message while clicking the button, that might be the result of a wrongly configured DNA Registration link.

* click register
* info about all required options
* click submit
