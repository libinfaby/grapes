Doctor Master
=============
A patient visits a hospital or clinic for doctor's consultation. Hence, preparing the Doctor Master is crucial. A well-prepared Doctor Master forms the foundation for all other associated activities to operate smoothly in a hospital or clinic. Below are the steps to prepare Doctor Master in the most efficient way.

1. DNA Registration
---------------------------------------------
DNA stands for **Doctor's Name and Address**. DNA Registration is done online and this is how we store the doctor details on our servers. This information is later used by our various mobile applications.

.. warning:: Before registering a doctor via DNA Registration you'll need to configure the DNA Registration link in the global settings.  

To register a doctor via DNA,

* Open Grapes Masters from *Masters > Grapes Masters* or by pressing *ctrl + G*
* Select Doctor Master
* On the newly opened form you'll see a button named **DNA Registration**
* Click on the button to open the DNA Registration website

  .. note:: If you still see an error message while clicking the button, that might be the result of a wrongly configured DNA Registration link in the global settings and policies.
